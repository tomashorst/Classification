# Classification

An overview of a machine learning classification task conducted as part of the "Machine Learning Fundamentals" course at Instituto Balseiro.
The task aimed to apply machine learning techniques to predict class labels in a given dataset.

Machine learning techniques have revolutionized the field of classification, enabling the automated identification and categorization of data patterns.
In this study, we tackle a classification task using machine learning algorithms to predict the target labels of a given dataset.
The primary objective of this research is to develop an effective classification model. To accomplish this, we explore and compare various popular machine learning algorithms,
including decision trees, support vector machines, random forests. We analyze their performance on the dataset and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses in terms of predictive accuracy, training time, and interpretability.
